## What Was Built

A complete MCP-aware AI agent system consisting of:

1. **11 SMC analysis tools** wrapped around the existing SMC engine and real-time candle store
2. **2 MCP resources** (live candles, system status) with URI templates and auto-completion
3. **1 reusable prompt template** for structured multi-step SMC analysis
4. **MCP-aware agent endpoint** (`POST /api/agents/ask-mcp`) with iterative tool calling
5. **Tool registry** for direct function execution (bypasses FastMCP internals)
6. **FastMCP server** for external MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

## Architecture

```
POST /api/agents/ask-mcp { question, history? }
  │
  ▼
Agent Loop (up to 3 rounds):
  │
  ├── 1. Send messages + tool definitions to Fireworks AI (DeepSeek V4 Pro)
  │       System prompt: ~200 tokens (vs 3K for classic endpoint)
  │       Tools: 11 SMC analysis functions in OpenAI function-calling format
  │
  ├── 2. Parse SSE stream:
  │       ┌─ content delta → stream to browser token-by-token
  │       └─ tool_calls delta → collect tool call (name + arguments)
  │
  ├── 3. Execute tool calls:
  │       └─ toolRegistry.get(name)(args) → direct function call
  │          └─ candleStore.getCandles() → SMC engine → JSON result
  │
  ├── 4. Feed tool results back to AI:
  │       └─ messages.push({ role: "tool", content: result })
  │
  └── 5. AI synthesizes final response → stream to browser
```

## Tool Registry

The tool registry maps tool names directly to their execute functions, bypassing FastMCP internals for the agent endpoint:

```typescript
toolRegistry.set("analyze_structure", async (args) => {
  const candles = candleStore.getCandles(args.symbol, args.timeframe);
  const result = analyzeStructure(candles, args.timeframe);
  return JSON.stringify({ trend, bias, confidence, phase, ... });
});
```

Each tool:
- Calls candleStore.getCandles() for live data (WebSocket + backfill)
- Runs the corresponding SMC engine module
- Returns structured JSON with relevant fields only (not full SmcReport)
- Handles errors gracefully (returns `{ error: "..." }` instead of throwing)

## SSE Protocol

| Event | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `{ content: "..." }` | Server → Browser | Token delta from AI response |
| `{ tool_start: "name" }` | Server → Browser | Tool call initiated |
| `{ tool_result: "name", content: "..." }` | Server → Browser | Tool execution result (first 200 chars) |
| `{ done: true }` | Server → Browser | Agent loop complete |

## Token Efficiency

| Scenario | Classic Endpoint | MCP Endpoint | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| "What's the BTC structure?" | ~3,000 tokens (full report in prompt) | ~200 system + ~500 tool result + ~300 response = ~1,000 | **3×** |
| "Where's the nearest liquidity?" | ~3,000 tokens | ~800 tokens | **3.75×** |
| "Analyze BTC on 4h and 1d" | ~3,000 tokens (no multi-TF in prompt) | ~2,000 tokens (two tool calls) | **1.5×** + **new capability** |
| Multi-tool chain (structure + liquidity + targets) | Not possible (single-prompt only) | ~3,000 tokens | **New capability** |

The real win is not just token savings — it's agency. The AI can now investigate, cross-reference, and chain analyses.

## Verified Results

### Test 1: Single Tool Call

**Input:** "What is the BTCUSDT market structure on 4h?"

**Output:**
```
Here's the BTCUSDT 4H market structure:
- Trend: Ranging
- Bias: Neutral
- Confidence: 78%
- Phase: Accumulation

What's happening: Price is consolidating inside an accumulation range with conflicting pivots
— no clear BOS or CHoCH has been registered on this timeframe. The high-confidence read suggests
the market is indecisive, coiling for a potential expansion.

For a deeper view, I could pull the 4H liquidity pools, order blocks, or the daily bias to see
which direction the higher timeframe favors. Want me to dig into any of those?
```

✅ Tool called: `analyze_structure`  
✅ Real data from candle store (BTCUSDT 4h, neutral bias, 0.78 confidence, accumulation)  
✅ AI offered to dig deeper with additional tools  

### Test 2: Multi-Tool Chain

**Input:** "Analyze BTCUSDT on 4h. Tell me the bias, the nearest liquidity pools, and the top draw target."

**Output:**
- 🔧 `analyze_structure` → neutral bias, accumulation, 78% confidence
- 🔧 `analyze_liquidity` → SSL at $58,150 (70% sweep), BSL at $65,582 (29%)
- 🔧 `get_draw_targets` → Bearish OB at $65,771 (score 1.4)
- Synthesized into a table with specific prices + TL;DR

✅ Three tools chained autonomously  
✅ AI decided which tools to call based on the question  
✅ All data from live WebSocket pipeline  
✅ Zero errors in server logs  

### Test 3: Classic Endpoint (unchanged)

✅ `POST /api/agents/ask` still works with updated model (DeepSeek V4 Pro)  
✅ `POST /api/agents/pipeline` still works  
✅ REST analysis, SSE stream, WebSocket — all unaffected

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "fastmcp": "^4.3.2",
    "zod": "^4.4.3"  // (already present, upgraded by fastmcp)
  }
}
```

Bundle size increased from 2.0MB → 5.4MB due to FastMCP. Cold start time unchanged.

---

## Running as External MCP Server

The FastMCP server can be started as a standalone MCP endpoint for external clients:

```json
// Claude Desktop / Claude Code config
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smc-pulse-predict": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

(Note: The HTTP server integration requires additional wiring — currently the tools are available through the agent endpoint. Full MCP HTTP transport can be added in a follow-up by mounting FastMCP on the Express app.)

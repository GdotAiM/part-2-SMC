# Frontend — SMC Pulse Predict

## Overview

The frontend is a React 18 SPA built with Vite and TypeScript. It connects to the backend over HTTP and renders a high-density, real-time market intelligence dashboard. There is no global state manager — all state lives in `dashboard.tsx` (server state via TanStack Query, UI state via `useState`).

**Design philosophy**: Information density over whitespace. Every pixel earns its place. Font is monospace throughout to align numbers in tabular contexts.

## Pages

The app has five pages: **Dashboard** (`/`), **Analytics** (`/analytics`), **Broker** (`/broker`), **Agent Loop** (`/agent-loop`), and **Not Found** (`*`).

### `pages/dashboard.tsx`

The only real page. Contains all application state and orchestrates all components.

**State**:
| State variable | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `market` | `"crypto" \| "forex"` | Selected market |
| `symbol` | `string` | Primary trading pair |
| `corrSym` | `string` | Correlated symbol for SMT |
| `smtOn` | `boolean` | Whether SMT is enabled |
| `styleIdx` | `number` | Active trading style (Scalp/Intraday/Swing/All) |
| `sheet` | `{ tf, report } \| null` | Which Intelligence Sheet is open |
| `confluenceSheetOpen` | `boolean` | Whether ConfluenceSheet is open |
| `chartOpen` | `boolean` | Whether ChartView is open |
| `countdown` | `number` | Seconds until next auto-refresh |
| `refreshing` | `boolean` | Whether a manual refresh is in progress |
| `wsConnected` | `boolean` | Real-time WebSocket connection status (from `useRealtimeStream`) |
| `liveData` | `Record<string, LiveTfData>` | Per-TF live price and candle data |
| `liveCandles` | `Record<string, CandleData[]>` | Live candle arrays passed to ChartView |

**Hooks — unconditional**:
All 7 timeframe hooks are called regardless of the active trading style (React's rules of hooks). Each hook is `enabled` based on whether its TF is in the active style's timeframe list. This pattern avoids conditional hook calls while still preventing unnecessary fetches.

```ts
const r1m  = useTfData(market, symbol, "1m",  corrParam, activeStyle.timeframes.includes("1m"));
const r5m  = useTfData(market, symbol, "5m",  corrParam, activeStyle.timeframes.includes("5m"));
// ... etc for all 7 TFs
```

**`useTfData` helper**:
Wraps `useAnalyzeCrypto` or `useAnalyzeForex` based on the market toggle. Passes a `staleTime: 60_000` so TanStack Query won't refetch more often than once per minute.

**Cascade computation**:
```ts
const cascade = useMemo(() => {
  // Anchor = highest-weight TF with loaded data
  const anchorTf = sorted.find(tf => tfMap[tf].data) ?? sorted[0];
  const anchorBias = getBias(anchorReport);
  return { roles, anchorTf, anchorBias };
}, [all 7 report data dependencies, activeStyle]);
```

The cascade determines:
- Which TF is the "Bias Setter" (highest weight with data)
- Which TFs are "Confirmation" (middle)
- Which TF is "Entry Trigger" (lowest weight)

**Real-time WebSocket stream** (`useRealtimeStream` hook):
```ts
const { liveData, connected: wsConnected, candles: liveCandles } = useRealtimeStream({
  symbol,
  timeframes: activeStyle.timeframes,
  // When server rebuilds SMC report after candle close, inject directly into query cache
  onReportUpdate: (tf, report) => {
    queryClient.setQueryData(queryKey, report);
  },
  // Fallback: trigger REST refetch if server-side rebuild isn't ready
  onCandleClosed: (_sym, tf) => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey });
  },
});
```

The hook connects to `GET /api/stream/:symbol` (SSE) and maintains:
- `liveData` — per-timeframe current price + candle state (for the LIVE badge)
- `candles` — per-timeframe candle arrays (passed to ChartView for in-place updates)
- `connected` — WebSocket status (green pulsing dot indicator)

**Live price badge** (header):
When the real-time stream is connected, a green pulsing `Radio` icon and "LIVE" badge appears next to the price. The price updates in real-time from the SSE `candle_update` events. The price renders in emerald green when live, falling back to the REST-sourced price when disconnected.

**Auto-refresh**:
A `setInterval` decrements `countdown` every second. When it hits 0, it calls `queryClient.refetchQueries({ type: "active" })` to refresh all loaded TF reports simultaneously. The countdown ring in the header is a pure SVG `strokeDashoffset` animation.

**Trading styles**:
```ts
const TRADING_STYLES = [
  { label: "Scalp",    timeframes: ["1m",  "5m",  "15m"] },
  { label: "Intraday", timeframes: ["15m", "1h",  "4h"]  },
  { label: "Swing",    timeframes: ["4h",  "1d",  "1w"]  },
  { label: "All",      timeframes: ["1m", "5m", "15m", "1h", "4h", "1d", "1w"] },
];
```

## Components

### `ConfluenceCard.tsx`

**Purpose**: Multi-timeframe cascade summary at the top of the dashboard. Shows the directional alignment of all active TFs at a glance.

**Props**:
- `reports: Array<{ tf: string; report: SmcReport }>`
- `cascade: { roles, anchorTf, anchorBias }`
- `onOpenConfluence: () => void` — opens ConfluenceSheet
- `onSelect: (tf) => void` — opens that TF's IntelligenceSheet

**Layout**:
```
MULTI-TF CONFLUENCE                         [BREAK AT M15]  Intelligence Sheet →
BEARISH DRAW
2 aligned · 1 counter-trend · anchor H4
TOP-DOWN CASCADE · H4 SETS THE DIRECTION

[H4 → BEARISH] → [H1 → BEARISH] → [M15 → BULLISH ⚠]
```

**Cascade summary logic**:
- Counts how many TFs are aligned with the anchor bias
- "Counter-trend" count = TFs with the opposite bias
- Builds a horizontal flow showing each TF as a pill with its bias
- Counter-trend TFs are highlighted in yellow with a warning

**Interactions**:
- Click any TF pill → `onSelect(tf)` → opens IntelligenceSheet for that TF
- Click "Intelligence Sheet →" → `onOpenConfluence()` → opens ConfluenceSheet

---

### `ConfluenceSheet.tsx`

**Purpose**: Full-screen overlay with all active TFs displayed side-by-side for top-down analysis.

**Props**:
- `reports: Array<{ tf, report }>`
- `cascade`
- `market`
- `onClose: () => void`

**Layout**: Horizontal scroll with one column per TF. Each column shows the full Intelligence Sheet content for that timeframe — bias, draw target, OBs, FVGs, structure, liquidity — all visible simultaneously.

**Use case**: Swing traders who need to see how all TFs align in a single view before committing to a direction.

---

### `IntelligenceSheet.tsx`

**Purpose**: The primary deep-analysis overlay for a single timeframe. Opens as a full-screen sheet when a TfAgentCard is tapped.

**Props**:
- `report: SmcReport`
- `market: Market`
- `anchorTf: string`
- `anchorBias: string`
- `role: string`
- `onClose: () => void`

**Sections**:

1. **Header bar**: Symbol, TF label, bias badge, role badge, narrative string, session state badge, close button

2. **Narrative banner**: Full market narrative string displayed in a highlighted banner

3. **Structure panel**:
   - Phase badge (Accumulation / Manipulation / Expansion / etc.)
   - Trend, bias, confidence %
   - Evidence bullets
   - Last 5 BOS/CHoCH breaks in a table (type, direction, price)

4. **Draw Targets panel**:
   - Top 3 ranked targets with score, direction, price, type label
   - Evidence tags shown as small chips
   - Confidence progress bar

5. **Order Blocks panel**:
   - All valid, unmitigated OBs
   - Type (Bull/Bear), proximal, distal, confidence %, strength
   - Confidence factor chips
   - Breaker and FVG badges

6. **Liquidity panel**:
   - BSL / SSL with price and `probabilityOfSweep %`
   - All pools list with type, price, touches, session, swept flag

7. **FVG panel**:
   - All unfilled FVGs with type, top, bottom, fill fraction bar
   - Inversion badge if applicable

8. **Daily Bias panel**:
   - Bias direction, strength %, consecutive days
   - Evidence bullets

9. **AI Analyst section**:
   - `AgentPipeline` — trigger and view the 4-agent sequential analysis
   - `AgentChat` — freeform Q&A with the AI analyst

**Styling**: Uses the same color scheme as the dashboard:
- Bullish = `hsl(var(--bullish))` — teal
- Bearish = `text-destructive` — red
- Primary = system primary color (cyan-ish)

---

### `TfAgentCard` (inline in `dashboard.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Summary card for a single timeframe, shown in the agent grid.

**Props**:
- `tf`, `report`, `market`, `isLoading`, `error`
- `role`, `anchorTf`, `anchorBias`, `isAnchor`
- `onOpen: () => void`

**Content**:
- Row 1: TF label + role badge + bias badge
- Row 2: Alignment badge ("Aligned with H4 · BEARISH" or "⚠ Counter-trend")
- Row 3: "NEXT DRAW ON LIQUIDITY" + price
- Row 4: Confidence % + confidence bar + SMT indicator
- Row 5: Alt target price
- Footer: "Tap for Intelligence Sheet →"

**Loading state**: Skeleton placeholder with `animate-pulse`
**Error state**: Red alert box with context-aware error message

---

### `ChartView.tsx`

**Purpose**: Full-screen interactive chart overlay. Shows candlestick data with all SMC overlays rendered on a `<canvas>` element positioned over the chart.

**Props**:
- `reports: Array<{ tf, report }>`
- `market`
- `initialTf?: string`
- `onClose: () => void`
- `liveCandles?: Record<string, CandleData[]>` — per-TF live candles from real-time stream

**Live candle updates** (`useEffect` on `[liveCandles, activeTf, activeReport]`):
When live candles arrive for the active timeframe, the chart series is updated in-place:
1. Tries `series.update()` for the latest candle (fast, in-place)
2. Falls back to `series.setData()` if the candle is new (appends + sorts)
This means the chart shows real-time price movement without full re-renders — only the last candle's OHLCV changes.

**Internal state**:
- `activeTf: string` — which TF is currently displayed

**Refs**:
- `containerRef` — the div that Lightweight Charts mounts into
- `canvasRef` — the overlay canvas for OB/FVG/session boxes
- `chartRef` — the `IChartApi` instance
- `seriesRef` — the `ISeriesApi<'Candlestick'>` instance
- `reportRef` — always-current report (avoids stale closure in canvas callbacks)

**Chart initialization** (`useEffect` on `[activeReport, market, redraw]`):
1. Create chart with dark theme (`#0d0d0d` background)
2. `chart.addSeries(CandlestickSeries, {...})` — v5 API
3. `series.setData(candles.sort by time)`
4. Add BSL/SSL price lines (dashed, labelled, with touch count)
5. Add EQ price line (dotted)
6. Build markers array: pivot HH/HL/LH/LL (circles) + BOS/CHoCH (arrows) + SMT (purple arrow)
7. `createSeriesMarkers(series, allMarkers)` — v5 API
8. Subscribe to `timeScale().subscribeVisibleTimeRangeChange` → `redraw()`
9. `ResizeObserver` → resize chart and canvas on container size change
10. Return cleanup: `ro.disconnect()`, `chart.remove()`

**Canvas overlay** (`drawOverlay()`):
Runs after every chart scroll/zoom/resize. Uses `ctx.save()` / `ctx.scale(dpr, dpr)` for correct DPR rendering.

Draw order (painter's algorithm — back to front):
1. **Session backgrounds** — coloured bands: Asian (blue), London (orange), NY AM (green), NY PM (purple)
2. **FVG rectangles** — extend from FVG candle to right edge; dashed border
3. **OB rectangles** — extend from OB candle to right edge; solid border + KZO dashed proximal line + label
4. **BOS/CHoCH dashed lines** — horizontal dashed line at the break price + "CHoCH" text label

All shapes use `timeToCoordinate()` and `priceToCoordinate()` for pixel mapping. Returns `null` if the time/price is outside the visible range — handled with a null guard to skip invisible shapes.

**TF selector**: Pill buttons for each loaded TF. Switching TF destroys and recreates the chart via the `useEffect` dependency on `activeReport`.

**Legend bar**: Shows colour swatches for Bull OB / Bear OB / FVG and text labels for BSL / SSL / BOS / CHoCH / SMT / EQ.

---

### `AgentPipeline.tsx`

**Purpose**: Triggers and streams the 4-agent sequential analysis pipeline.

**State**:
- `results: Record<string, string>` — accumulated text per agent
- `status: "idle" | "running" | "done" | "error"`
- `activeAgent: string | null`

**Trigger**: A "Run Analysis" button. On click, opens an `EventSource`-like fetch stream to `POST /api/agents/pipeline`.

**SSE parsing**:
Reads the raw SSE stream using `ReadableStream` + `TextDecoder`. Parses each `data: {...}` line:
- `type: "start"` → set `activeAgent`, clear that agent's accumulated text
- `type: "delta"` → append `content` to the agent's result text
- `type: "done"` → mark agent complete
- `type: "pipeline_done"` → set `status: "done"`, clear `activeAgent`

**Rendering**: Four labelled panels — "Structure Agent", "Liquidity Agent", "FVG Agent", "Confluence Agent". The active panel has a pulsing indicator. Text appears token by token using accumulated state.

---

### `TradeActions.tsx`

**Purpose**: Execute Now and Monitor with Agent buttons in the IntelligenceSheet.

- **Execute Now**: Calls POST /api/signals/execute with derived entry/SL/TP levels
- **Monitor with Agent**: Calls startLoopMonitor() for symbol/timeframe
- **Broker status bar**: Inline mode switcher with typed-LIVE confirmation

---

### `AgentLoopSection.tsx`

**Purpose**: Embedded Agent Loop trigger inside IntelligenceSheet.

- "Run Full Agent Loop" button triggers 7-step cycle via SSE
- Streaming timeline with step durations
- Decision/signal/result cards

---

### `MarketIntelligence.tsx`

**Purpose**: News, Similar Setups, RAG context panel.

- **News**: Headlines with impact badges, macro events calendar
- **Similar**: Vector search past setups with setup type dropdown
- **RAG**: Formatted news context for LLM injection
- Graceful degradation when NEWS_ENABLED=false or Qdrant not running

---

### `BacktestRunnerUI.tsx`

**Purpose**: Backtest runner integrated into Performance Matrix tab.

- Asset class toggle, symbol dropdown, all 7 TFs
- 4 lookback presets: Aggressive / Normal / Cautious / Deep dive
- Results: Win Rate, Sharpe, PF, Max DD, Avg Win/Loss
- "Refresh Matrix" button after completion

---

### `AgentChat.tsx`

**Purpose**: Freeform Q&A with the AI analyst, scoped to the current timeframe's report.

**State**:
- `messages: Array<{ role, content }>` — conversation history
- `inputValue: string` — current input field content
- `streaming: boolean` — whether a response is in flight

**Flow**:
1. User types question and submits
2. Adds user message to `messages`
3. Opens fetch stream to `POST /api/agents/ask` with question + report + last 8 messages
4. Reads SSE deltas → appends to current assistant message in real-time
5. On `done: true` → finalises the message, sets `streaming: false`

**UX details**:
- Auto-scrolls to bottom on each new token
- Input is disabled while streaming
- Shows a pulsing cursor `█` while streaming

## Data Flow

```
Dashboard mounts
    ↓
useTfData() × 7 → useAnalyzeCrypto() / useAnalyzeForex()
    ↓
GET /api/analysis/crypto?symbol=BTCUSDT&timeframe=4h → SmcReport JSON
    ↓
TanStack Query stores in cache (staleTime: 60s)
    ↓
React renders TfAgentCard components with report data
    ↓
User taps card → setSheet({ tf, report }) → IntelligenceSheet mounts
    ↓
User taps "SMT" → AgentPipeline runs → POST /api/agents/pipeline (SSE)
    ↓
User asks question → AgentChat runs → POST /api/agents/ask (SSE)
    ↓
User taps CHART → setChartOpen(true) → ChartView mounts
    ↓
ChartView creates Lightweight Charts instance + canvas overlay
    ↓
User switches TF pill → setActiveTf → chart recreated with new report
```

## Routing

`App.tsx` uses Wouter for client-side routing with four routes:
- `/` → `<Dashboard />`
- `/analytics` → `<Analytics />`
- `/broker` → `<Broker />`
- `/agent-loop` → `<AgentLoop />`
- `*` → `<NotFound />`

The Broker and Analytics pages are navigated via header buttons in Dashboard, styled identically to the CHART button (border, bg-muted, hover:text-primary pattern).

---

### `pages/Broker.tsx`

The broker management dashboard at `/broker`. Polls `/api/broker/status`, `/api/account`, and `/api/ledger` every 15 seconds.

**Sections:**

1. **Connection status card**: Broker name, connected Badge (green), PAPER Badge (blue), LIVE/REVIEW mode Badge — the most visually dominant element, with a pulsing `Radio` icon for LIVE mode matching the dashboard's live price indicator pattern.

2. **Mode switch**: REVIEW/LIVE toggle using shadcn `Switch`. Flipping to LIVE opens an `AlertDialog` requiring the user to type "LIVE" into an `Input` before the confirm button enables — matches the backend's `{ confirm: "LIVE" }` requirement. Flipping to REVIEW requires no dialog (kill-switch behavior).

3. **Account overview**: 4 `Card` components showing Total Value, Cash (emerald), Buying Power (blue), and Positions Value. Currency-formatted via `fmtDollar()`.

4. **Open orders table**: Uses the same `Table`/`TableHeader`/`TableRow` patterns as `TradeLedgerDashboard`. Columns: Order ID (truncated), Symbol, Side (green BUY / red SELL Badge), Qty, Price, Status (color-coded: FILLED green, PENDING amber, REJECTED red, CANCELLED gray), Created time.

5. **Execution log**: Recent entries from `/api/ledger` filtered to REVIEW/LIVE modes. LIVE entries show a `Radio` icon badge distinguishing them from REVIEW previews. Outcome column shows WIN/LOSS/PENDING badges.

6. **Not-connected state**: When `is_ready: false`, shows a centered `Card` with `AlertTriangle` icon explaining that `ALPACA_API_KEY_ID` and `ALPACA_API_SECRET_KEY` need to be set on the server, plus a "Back to Dashboard" button.

### `pages/AgentLoop.tsx` (NEW)

The Agent Loop page at `/agent-loop` wraps the `AgentLoopDashboard` component. It provides a standalone interface for running the AI Agent Loop system — one-shot analysis cycles, background monitors, run history, and memory inspection.

```
AgentLoop (page)
└── AgentLoopDashboard
    ├── Loop Runner (Run Loop tab)
    │   ├── Symbol + timeframe inputs
    │   ├── Run Loop button → SSE event stream
    │   └── Real-time step/decision/signal/result display
    ├── Monitor Manager (Monitors tab)
    │   ├── Start monitor form
    │   ├── Active monitors list with status indicators
    │   └── Stop button per monitor
    ├── Run History (History tab)
    │   ├── Refresh button
    │   ├── Runs list with score/status badges
    │   └── Expandable step-level trace detail
    └── Memory Viewer (Memory tab)
        ├── Load memory button
        └── Entries list with tags, source, score
```

**State management**: All state is local via `useState` — fetched from REST endpoints on demand (no TanStack Query needed for this admin-style page).

---

### `pages/Analytics.tsx`

Trade ledger and performance analytics at `/analytics`. Three-tab layout using shadcn `Tabs`:

- **Ledger tab**: `TradeLedgerDashboard` component — filterable signal table with asset/setup/symbol/mode selectors, metric cards (win rate, Sharpe, profit factor, trade count), clickable rows opening `SignalDetailSheet`
- **Matrix tab**: `PerformanceMatrixHeatmap` — setup rankings by Sharpe ratio with colored bars
- **Generate tab**: Signal generator UI — market toggle, symbol/timeframe selectors, generate button. Shows resulting signal with Entry/SL/TP prices, R:R ratio, confidence bar

---

## API Communication

All communication with the backend goes through wrappers in `lib/api-client-react`:

```ts
// TanStack Query hook (generated, manually maintained)
const { data, isLoading, error } = useAnalyzeCrypto({
  symbol: "BTCUSDT",
  timeframe: "4h",
  correlatedSymbol: "ETHUSDT",
});
```

AI endpoints use raw `fetch()` with `ReadableStream` for SSE, since TanStack Query does not support streaming.

Real-time streaming uses the same SSE pattern via `lib/realtime.ts`:
```ts
// Hook wraps fetch() + ReadableStream SSE parsing
import { useRealtimeStream } from "@/lib/realtime";
const { liveData, connected, candles } = useRealtimeStream({ symbol, timeframes, ... });
```

### Frontend File Layout (with real-time additions)

```

## Type Safety

The frontend types in `lib/api-client-react/src/generated/api.schemas.ts` are **manually maintained** (not auto-generated from the OpenAPI spec at build time). This was a deliberate choice to avoid codegen complexity in the monorepo. All new backend fields are added as `optional` to maintain backward compatibility.

The `SmcReport` interface on the frontend mirrors the backend's `SmcReport` in `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/smc/types.ts`. Any new field added to the backend type must be manually added to the frontend type as optional.
